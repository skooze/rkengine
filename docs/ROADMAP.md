# Roadmap

## Alpha → Beta
- D3D12 real backend and Vulkan parity on Windows.
- Runtime asset packs (binary content bundles).
- Multi-agent orchestration (Planner/Coder/QA) with retrieval.

## Mid Term
- Editor prototype (content browser + live instructions).
- Audio + physics plugins.
- RHI abstraction improvements (pipeline/shader assets).

## Long Term
- Android / iOS backends (stubbed today).
- Console backends (Xbox/PlayStation/Switch) once SDKs + NDAs are in place.
- Cloud telemetry + remote config (Bedrock integration).

## Constraints
- Console/mobile support requires proprietary SDKs and platform-specific tooling.
- No proprietary headers/libs are included in this repo.
