# RKG Vision — Editor-First, Chat-Driven Building

RKG’s north star is an **Editor-first experience** where the very first run is a real GUI editor.
You should be able to see a demo scene in the viewport, click Play/Pause/Step without launching
another binary, and drive changes live using a docked chat panel that runs plan/apply workflows.

## What “Editor-first” means
- **Single entrypoint**: launch the Editor, not a standalone runtime.
- **In-editor Play mode**: simulation runs in-process with Play/Pause/Step/Stop.
- **Docked GUI**: viewport, scene, inspector, content, chat, and agent runs panels.
- **Chat-driven building**: plan/apply runs in the background, artifacts surfaced in UI.
